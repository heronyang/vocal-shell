/*
 * This is a simple example of pocketsphinx application that uses continuous listening
 * with silence filtering to automatically segment a continuous stream of audio input
 * into utterances that are then decoded.
 *
 * Remarks:
 *   - Each utterance is ended when a silence segment of at least 1 sec is recognized.
 *   - Single-threaded implementation for portability.
 *   - Uses audio library; can be replaced with an equivalent custom library.
